The Healthbar OBS Scrit provides an Source to dispay an lifebar / healthbar in your OBS Scenes.

to use an bar:
1) unzip the script in an directory on your computer
2) add the Script in OBS (Toosl / Scripts / +)
3) write an control file as an plain text file or use the provided file HealthBar_control.txt
4) set the location of the control file in the options of the Script in OBS
5) add the Source "Health Bar" to your Scene as often as you like

Whenever you save the control-file, the Healthbar(s) will update.


You can set the minimum to negative numbers

To use it for an Earthdawn or Star Wars Damagepoint System instead of a lifepoint system
set the maximum to 0 and the minimum to the limit (like -100 for a death rating of 100).
Then count the damagepoint as negative numbers like 10 damage points are a current of -10.
